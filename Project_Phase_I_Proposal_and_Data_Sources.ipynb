        "Y Combinator is one of the most prestigious startup accelerators in the world, having funded companies like Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, and Reddit. What factors contribute to the success of YC-backed startups? I'm interested in examining two key questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Can we predict a startup's industry/category based on its characteristics (such as founding year, location, and team size)? This would help investors and founders understand what types of companies thrive in different sectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Is there a relationship between a company's founding year and its success metrics (such as funding raised or company status)? This could reveal trends in startup ecosystems over time and help identify optimal timing for launching certain types of companies.\n",
        "\n",
        "These questions have practical applications: the first could help accelerator programs tailor their support to specific industries, while the second could provide insights into market cycles and timing strategies for entrepreneurs. Understanding these patterns could also help predict which types of startups are more likely to succeed or get acquired based on historical YC data."
